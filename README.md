I've just started learning React Native and this is my first React Native app.

# KemonoApp
KemonoApp is a React Native Android application designed to provide a seamless experience for browsing creators and posts on the Kemono website. While it currently focuses on essential features, such as viewing images, watching videos, and favoriting content, it serves as a valuable learning exercise for React Native development for me, and more features will be coming later.

# Features
- Browsing Creators and Posts
- Favoirtes Creators and Posts
- Media Viewing
- Download Content
- No Ads

# Platform
Currenlty KemonoApp exclusively targets the Android platform. There are no plans for iOS for now.

# Development and Updates
I aspire to incorporate all Kemono website features into this app. However, some features may lack corresponding APIs, so I cannot guarantee their inclusion. And I also have my full time job which means that updates may not be frequent. Nevertheless, I remain committed to improving KemonoApp.

# Feedback and Bug Reports
Feel free to share your thoughts, suggestions, or advice. If you encounter any bugs or issues while using the app, please let me know. Iâ€™ll do my best to address them promptly.

# Clone and Customize
You can clone this repository and use it as a foundation for creating your own customized KemonoApp.

# Build
```bat
eas build -p android --profile preview --platform android
```
